Everything Graphically Accelerated
----------------------------------

This is the no fun option, using GLAMOR where possible to render GPU tasks, leaving the CPU
free to perform other tasks.

Intended to take advantage of both GLAMOR and UXA's blitter interface in order to accelerate desktop graphics,
meaning that all graphical operations are performed on the GPU. While copies are done using the blitter engine,
within limitations.

EGA requires at least OpenGL 2.1 support, which is the bare minimum for GLAMOR.
Therefore pre-GMA X3100 era hardware (gen 4.x) will not work with EGA, such hardware will be forced
into SNA/UXA or software rendering instead.

Benefits over SNA/UXA:
- Runs entirely on the GPU, no CPU usage for 2D.
- Better compatibility, supports more modern Intel hardware.
- More flexible usage of the blitter engine, where applicable.

TODO:
- Implement EGA. []
- Get basic EGA acceleration working. []
- See if it's feasible to utilize the BLT engine in scenarios. []
	- Implement BLT where applicable to help with Glamor acceleration. []
	- Allow disabling it. []
	- Don't use BLT on Gen 7.x if mitigations are active. []
- Add support for modern Intel hardware (a la Gen20/Xe2) []
